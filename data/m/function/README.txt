If you are on a server, please make sure the flying is enabled. You can check this in your servers folder in the server.properties where you'll find saying "allow-flight=...", make sure it is set to true (it should be one of the first ones listed).
Make also sure that command blocks are enabled, this is also found in the server.properties and is called "enable-command-block=..." which should also be set to true.
